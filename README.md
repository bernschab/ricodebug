ricodebug
=========

The name "ricodebug" is a tribute to Johnny Rico, main character of the awesome movie Starship Troopers. His aim was to fight all bugs - and so is ours.

Introduction
------------

ricodebug is a GDB frontend for system engineers developed in Python. It is strongly focused on visually supported debugging using data structure graphs and SystemC features.

During the last year this debugger frontend was part of a student project at the Upper Austrian University Of Applied Sciences Hagenberg, department Embedded Systems Design. As this project ends in June 2011 the sources will be published under the GPLv3 for further development.

All participants of the former student project will continue working on ricodebug to share their knowledge in this open source project.
